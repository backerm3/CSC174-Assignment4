                    <h2>Greg Marshall</h2>
                    <p>"Greg Marshall (often referred to as Greg The Great for
                      his genius and winning personality) was born in Syracuse, New York. He
                      lived out the majority of his childhood there before graduating from
                      high school at Jordan-Elbridge High School. He decided he would attend
                      the University of Rochester to pursue a degree in Biology, a science
                      which he maintains a love for today, but found that it was not a field
                      he wished to develop a career in. Pivoting substantially, he entered a
                      business program at Rochester's Simon School of Business. It was also
                      around this time he chose to tryout for the Men's rowing team.
                      It represented a transition from years of running, so the significant
                      cardiovascular nature of rowing appealled to him.
                      He continues his pursuit of a B.S. in business today, and his love for
                      his team and the sport of rowing grows with every early morning practice."</p>
