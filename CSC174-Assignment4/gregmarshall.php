		<h1>Greg Marshall</h1>
		<em>Entrepreneur, Fitness Trainer and Advocate, Competitive Athlete</em>
		<p>Greg Marshall (often referred to as Greg The Great for his genius and
			winning personality) was born in Syracuse, New York. He lived out the
			majority of his childhood there before graduating from high school at
			Jordan-Elbridge High School. He decided he would attend the University of
			Rochester to pursue a degree in Biology, a science which he maintains a
			love for today, but found that it was not a field he wished to develop a
			career in. Pivoting substantially, he entered a business program at
			Rochester's Simon School of Business. It was also around this time he
			chose to tryout for the Men's rowing team. It represented a transition
			from years of running, so the significant cardiovascular nature of rowing
			appealled to him. He continues his pursuit of a B.S. in business today,
			and his love for his team and the sport of rowing grows with every early
			morning practice.</p>
