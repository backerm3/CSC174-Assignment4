		<h1>Greg (the Great) Marshall</h1>
		
		<p>Greg Marshall (often referred to as Greg The Great for 
		his genius and winning personality) was born in Syracuse, New York. He 
		lived out the majority of his childhood there before graduating from 
		high school at Jordan-Elbridge High School. He decided he would attend 
		the University of Rochester to pursue a degree in Biology, a science 
		which he maintains a love for today, but found that it was not a field 
		he wished to develop a career in. Pivoting dramatically, he entered a 
		business program at Rochester's Simon School of Business. It was also 
		around this time he chose to tryout for the Men's rowing team. He 
		continues his pursuit of a B.S. and business today, and his love for 
		his team and the sport of rowing grows with every early morning practice.
