                <h2>Greg Marshall</h2>
            <p> "Greg Marshall (often referred to as Greg The Great for 
          his genius and winning personality) was born in Syracuse, New York. He 
          lived out the majority of his childhood there before graduating from 
          high school at Jordan-Elbridge High School. He decided he would attend 
          the University of Rochester to pursue a degree in Biology, a science 
          which he maintains a love for today, but found that it was not a field 
          he wished to develop a career in. Pivoting substantially, he entered a 
          business program at Rochester's Simon School of Business. It was also 
          around this time he chose to tryout for the Men's rowing team. 
          It represented a transition from years of running, so the significant 
          cardovascular nature of rowing appealled to him. 
          He continues his pursuit of a B.S. in business today, and his love for 
          his team and the sport of rowing grows with every early morning practice." </p>
